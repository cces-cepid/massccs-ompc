# MassCSS: A high performance collision cross-section software for inter-node execution

Massive Collision Cross Section calculations for large macromolecular assemblies (MassCCS). MassCCS is an efficient parallel software for calculating Collision Cross Section (CCS) under the trajectory method (TM) for any macromolecular structure regardless of its size, shape and surface rugosity, without significant loss of accuracy or performance.

MassCCS relies on the linked-cell algorithm for computing intermolecular forces, ellipsoid projection approximation and efficient parallelization techniques that greatly enhance its performance in comparison to available TM CCS codes.

MassCCS is written in C++ and supports OpenMP. Extensive tests on calculation accuracy, speed up gains, and scalability with system size were performed. MassCCS efficiency is particularly scalable for multiple CPU cores.

If you use MassCCS in your research please, cite the following papers:

### The repository contents:
[`src`](src): This directory contains massccs source codes.

[`doc`](doc): This directory contains an updated user manual.

[`data`](data): This directory contains information of data set of CCS calculations performed in this work.

## Installation 

Download the MassCCS or clone the repository on your computer:
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cces-cepid/massccs.git
```
## Required Software

MassCCS depends on the following software:

* C++9.3+
* CMake 3.13+

On Ubuntu/Debian, you can simply run the following commands to install them with the package manager:
```bash
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

## Installing

This software uses CMake 3.13+ as its build system generator. On your terminal,
run the following commands to compile the source code:

```bash
cd massccs
mkdir build # Create build directory
cd build
cmake .. # Generate Makefiles
make  # Compile the program
```

There are optional compilation option that can be used, to see a list of all of them run `cmake -LH ..`.

## Run

```bash
cd .. # need to execute massccs from root dir
srun -N2  --mpi=pmi2 singularity exec runtime_latest.sif ./build/bin/massccs input.json
```

For more information about the software installation and used review the ["MassCCS doc"](https://massccs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
