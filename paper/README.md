* job_ompc.sh slurm job script to perform calculation to specify nodes, in this case for 9 nodes, one head node and 8 workers nodes, execute using the following command
```bash
sbatch job_ompc.sh sorlist.dat input.json He
```

* job_ompc_tasks slurm job script to perform calculation with more tasks that workers nodes, in this case for 9 nodes, one head node and 8 workers nodes, execute using the following command
```bash
sbatch job_ompc_tasks.sh sorlist.dat input.json He
```

* The outputs directory contains the ouput files for the CCS calculation for Helium and Nitorgen buffer gases, run in a 2, 4, 8 and 16, workers nodes.

## The repository contents:

[`Helium`](Helium): This directory contains output for CCS calculations using Helium buffer gas.

[`Nitrogen`](Nitorgen): This directory contains output for CCS calculations using Nitrogen buffer gas.

[`Helium_tasks`](Helium): This directory contains output for CCS calculations using more tasks than available workers nodes for Helium buffer gas.

[`Nitrogen_tasks`](Nitorgen): This directory contains output for CCS calculations using more tasks than available workers nodes for Nitrogen buffer gas.
